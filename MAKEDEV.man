.TH MAKEDEV 8 "14th August 1994" Linux "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
MAKEDEV \- create devices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "cd dev; ./MAKEDEV [ -n ] [ -v ] update"
.br
.BI "cd dev; ./MAKEDEV [ -n ] [ -v ]" "device"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B MAKEDEV
is a script that will create the devices in \fC/dev\fP used to interface
with drivers in the kernel.
.PP
Note that programs giving the error \(*QENOENT: No such file or
directory\(*U normally means that the device file is missing, whereas
\(*QENODEV: No such device\(*U normally means the kernel does not have the
driver configured or loaded.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-V
Print out version (actually RCS version information) and exit.
.TP
.B \-n
Do not actually update the devices, just print the actions that would be
performed.
.TP
.B \-d
Delete the devices.  The main use for this flag is by
.I MAKEDEV
itself.
.TP
.B \-v
Be verbose.  Print out the actions as they are performed.  This is the
same output as produced by
.BR \-n .
.SH CUSTOMISATION
Since there is no standardisation in what names are used for system users
and groups, it is possible that you may need to modify
.B MAKEDEV
to reflect your site's settings.  Near the top of the file is a mapping
from device type to user, group and permissions (e.g. all CD-ROM devices
are set from the \fC$cdrom\fP variable).  If you wish to change the
defaults, this is the section to edit.
.SH DEVICES
.TP
.B General Options
.TP
.B update
This only works on kernels which have \fC/proc/interrupts\fP (introduced
during 1.1.x).  This file is scanned to see what devices are currently
configured into the kernel, and this is compared with the previous
settings stored in the file called \fCDEVICES\fP.
Devices which are new since then or have a different major number are
created, and those which are no longer configured are deleted.
